###1. Introduction

The __labPy__ project is an activity for OpenClassrooms Python course.
This is the last activity for this course.

The goal of this activity is to create a mini maze game, multiplayer network.
This time the backup is not requested, but it will include a series of unit tests.

###2. How It Works ?

1. you type your Name, it must be unique
2. you type the symbol (any symbol on keybord) witch will represent yourself on the map
3. type c wen you are ready

The players are randomly placed on the map

**The goal** : You must be the first to join the output represented by U

Commands are :

    s : to go to the south
    n : for north
    e : for east
    o : west "ouest in French"
    
    you can specify the number of compartment you want to move like this :
    s3 => 3 compartment to the south
    
    you can close a door (. symbol on the map) by entering m like this
    mn => close the door witch is on the north of your character
    
    you can open a door in a wall by entering p like this
    ps => create a door on the wall witch in your south direction
    
    To stop the game, type : fin
